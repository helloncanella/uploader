00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:06.158
I recently read
that during World War Two,

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.544
Joseph Stalin had
a research program

3
00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:10.162
to create
supersoldiers

4
00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:13.732
by having women
impregnated by gorillas.

5
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:17.169
What a sick use
of science.

6
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:19.421
Hey, as long as
the baby's healthy.

7
00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:23.142
I wonder if Stalin considered
any other animals.

8
00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.177
Hippos are
the deadliest creature.

9
00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.263
A half-human, half-hippo soldier
would be pretty badass.

10
00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.433
Yes, but when they're
hungry-hungry,

11
00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.352
you can stop them
with marbles.

12
00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:35.771
Yeah, the correct animal

13
00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:38.407
for interspecies supersolider
is koala.

14
00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.911
You would wind up with an army
so cute it couldn't be attacked.

15
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.832
But half-man, half-owl
could fly...

16
00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.419
The answer is cuddly soldiers
with big flat noses. Moving on.

17
00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:53.088
So, Penny, when's
the new job start?

18
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.289
Next Monday.

19
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:55.758
Did you get a chance
to look over

20
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.709
the materials I gave you?

21
00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:57.876
Uh, not yet,
but I will.

22
00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:00.095
Great. When?

23
00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:02.214
I said I'll get to it.

24
00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:09.004
I'm sensing awkwardness,
am I right?

25
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.973
Yes.

26
00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.142
Swish.

27
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.061
I don't want to be pushy,

28
00:01:16.063 --> 00:01:18.814
but you've never done
pharmaceutical sales before.

29
00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:21.233
It seems like you could use
this time to get a head start.

30
00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:22.735
Well, the first few
weeks will be all training.

31
00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:25.404
They'll tell me everything
I need to know.

32
00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:26.955
But imagine how impressed
they'd be if you showed up

33
00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:28.374
already familiar
with the material.

34
00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.909
Okay, so what, you want me
to be like a teacher's pet?

35
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:33.045
Couldn't hurt.

36
00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:33.912
Mm, I don't know.

37
00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:35.664
Who here has ever been hurt

38
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.416
because they were
the teacher's pet?

39
00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:43.922
It was like the rest of
the class<i> wanted</i> Ms. McDonald

40
00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:45.674
to forget the quiz.

41
00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:49.311
âª Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state âª

42
00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:52.648
âª Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! âª

43
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.266
âª The Earth began to cool âª

44
00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:56.819
âª The autotrophs began to drool,

45
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:59.488
âª We built the Wall âª
âª<i> We built the pyramids</i> âª

46
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.157
âª Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery âª

47
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.076
âª That all started
with a big bang âª

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:04.578

51
00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:17.350
Mrs. Davis.

52
00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:19.452
Guess who?

53
00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:20.720
Dr. Cooper.

54
00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:22.888
That's right, good job.

55
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.391
Hello.

56
00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:27.560
Uh, you wanted
to see me?

57
00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:29.178
Yes. Uh, welcome back.

58
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.613
Thank you.

59
00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:33.232
I assume you'd like
to reopen our dialogue

60
00:02:33.234 --> 00:02:36.068
about the university forcing me
to continue with string theory?

61
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.720
You mean the dialogue that went,

62
00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:41.207
"Please?" "No." "Please?" "No."
"Please?" "No."

63
00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.210
That's the one.

64
00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:48.831
I believe you went last,
so, uh, please?

65
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.585
Dr. Cooper, while you were away,
we came up with a solution

66
00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:55.004
that would allow you to change
your field of study.

67
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.756
Wow.

68
00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:59.892
Pouting and running away
actually worked.

69
00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:02.728
Yeah, I must say,
that may not be a lesson

70
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.096
you want to reinforce with me.

71
00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:07.767
So, um, what is the solution?

72
00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.435
Currently, you're being paid
under a grant

73
00:03:09.437 --> 00:03:11.404
to specifically research
string theory.

74
00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:13.356
If we promote you
to junior professor,

75
00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:15.074
you'll be able to choose

76
00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:16.959
whatever field of research
you'd like.

77
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.181
But if I'm a professor,
then I'll have to teach a class.

78
00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:23.649
That is correct.

79
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:29.622
So your solution is to
promote me and pay me more money

80
00:03:29.624 --> 00:03:31.507
so that I can impart
my knowledge

81
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.542
to the next generation
of scientists?

82
00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:34.910
Yes.

83
00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:38.297
You people are sick.

84
00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:43.352
Hey.

85
00:03:43.354 --> 00:03:44.720
Ready to go to lunch?

86
00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:46.055
Just give me a minute.

87
00:03:46.057 --> 00:03:47.440
I'm stimulating the pleasure
cells of this starfish.

88
00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:48.641
I just need to turn it off.

89
00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:50.609
What happens
if you don't?

90
00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:51.961
Then I have to sit through lunch

91
00:03:51.963 --> 00:03:54.647
knowing this starfish is
having a better day than I am.

92
00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:58.117
Is Bernadette meeting us
at the restaurant?

93
00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.053
Uh, no. Actually,
I didn't invite her.

94
00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.154
How come?

95
00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.323
Well, ever since she helped me
get this job,

96
00:04:04.325 --> 00:04:05.791
she won't stop bugging me.

97
00:04:05.793 --> 00:04:08.461
Well, I think she just wants you
to do well,

98
00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:09.745
and she's worried that you won't

99
00:04:09.747 --> 00:04:14.083
'cause you were just
a stunningly poor waitress.

100
00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:15.384
That is not true.

101
00:04:15.386 --> 00:04:17.103
I'm still waiting
on my mini corndogs

102
00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:19.221
from two years ago.

103
00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:22.775
I told you,
they'll be right out.

104
00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:26.228
Okay, so no
Bernadette.

105
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.814
Well, you saw her the
other night. Am I wrong?

106
00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:30.015
No, I just...

107
00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:32.902
I feel kind of uncomfortable
talking about her like this.

108
00:04:32.904 --> 00:04:35.905
Usually when someone's being
talked about behind their back,

109
00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:38.691
it's me and it's right
in front of my face.

110
00:04:38.693 --> 00:04:41.827
I-I'm sorry. I just need
a little break from her.

111
00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:43.863
I understand.

112
00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:47.867
You know, there is
some research that indicates

113
00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:51.036
that sharing negative attitudes
about a third party

114
00:04:51.038 --> 00:04:54.173
can be a powerful bonding force
between two friends.

115
00:04:55.592 --> 00:04:57.042
So, what are
you saying?

116
00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:59.762
I'm saying,
in the spirit of science,

117
00:04:59.764 --> 00:05:02.181
what is
that little skank's problem?

118
00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:07.803
So, I've been trying
to come up

119
00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:09.722
with a cute couple's nickname
for me and Emily.

120
00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:11.390
What do you
like better--

121
00:05:11.392 --> 00:05:14.693
Emippali...

122
00:05:14.695 --> 00:05:17.229
or Koothrapemily?

123
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:20.933
Why is it your last name
and her first name?

124
00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:22.902
Oh, well,
her last name is Sweeney,

125
00:05:22.904 --> 00:05:27.239
and something just didn't seem
right about Koothrapeeney.

126
00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:31.827
Hey, how'd it go
with human resources?

127
00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:33.245
Awful.

128
00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:35.581
Yeah, they're allowing me
to move on from string theory,

129
00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:37.500
but they made me
a junior professor

130
00:05:37.502 --> 00:05:39.802
and are requiring me
to teach a class.

131
00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:42.588
I don't understand. Why is it
bad that you have to teach?

132
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.057
What a stupid question.

133
00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:49.428
The kids are
gonna love him.

134
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.397
I can't believe
I have to waste my time

135
00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.566
babysitting a bunch
of grad students

136
00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:57.570
who probably think dark matter
is what's in their diapers.

137
00:05:57.572 --> 00:05:59.104
This might not be that bad.

138
00:05:59.106 --> 00:06:01.273
Uh, you like telling people
they're wrong.

139
00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:02.608
Wrong!

140
00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:07.112
Just because I enjoyed that one
doesn't mean I always do.

141
00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:09.665
You enjoy giving
people grades.

142
00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:13.786
A valid point,
but unoriginal-- B-minus.

143
00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:15.955
And you love the sound
of your own voice.

144
00:06:15.957 --> 00:06:17.706
Yeah, well, of course I do.

145
00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:18.841
Listen to it.

146
00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:22.127
It's like an earful
of melted caramel.

147
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.346
Look, most importantly,

148
00:06:24.348 --> 00:06:27.216
this will let you move on
and study dark matter.

149
00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:31.136
It is true that many of
my heroes have taken students

150
00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:32.438
under their wings:

151
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.774
Feynman, Einstein, Professor X.

152
00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:38.227
Humorously,

153
00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.728
in the case of Professor X,

154
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.147
some of his students
actually had wings.

155
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.400
That's rich.

156
00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:47.553
I'll use that one
to lighten the mood

157
00:06:47.555 --> 00:06:50.656
after my entire class
fails the midterm.

158
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.379
Measuring starfish
serotonin levels in response

159
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:01.500
to one point two molar
stimulation of pleasure cells.

160
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.205
You like that, don't you?

161
00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:07.973
That's right, say my name.

162
00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:13.762
Hey.

163
00:07:13.764 --> 00:07:15.514
Hey, what's going on?
Not much.

164
00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:16.932
You want to get a drink later?

165
00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:18.150
Just the two of us?

166
00:07:18.152 --> 00:07:19.152
No Penny?

167
00:07:19.153 --> 00:07:20.235
Not tonight.

168
00:07:20.237 --> 00:07:21.437
I'm a little frustrated
with her.

169
00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.322
Because you got her the job
and you think

170
00:07:23.324 --> 00:07:25.190
she should be working harder
to prepare for it?

171
00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:28.861
So it's not just me.
You see it, too!

172
00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:33.365
I do, I see it.

173
00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:34.984
It's driving me crazy.

174
00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:36.835
Just this afternoon,
I saw on Instagram

175
00:07:36.837 --> 00:07:39.254
that instead of studying,
she went out to lunch

176
00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:41.006
and got a manicure.

177
00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:44.543
That's outrageous!

178
00:07:44.545 --> 00:07:45.711
I know!

179
00:07:45.713 --> 00:07:47.046
If she doesn't do well,

180
00:07:47.048 --> 00:07:49.665
Th-this could reflect poorly
on you.

181
00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:53.068
Exactly. Does she not realize it
or does she not care?

182
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.286
I don't know.

183
00:07:54.288 --> 00:07:56.689
The important thing is
I am here for you

184
00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:00.893
so we can mutually disparage
this unpleasing third party.

185
00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:08.751
Hey. We just wanted to see

186
00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:10.486
how your class was going.
Where is everybody?

187
00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:13.038
There is no class.

188
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.291
Did you send everyone to
the principal's office already?

189
00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:19.578
No one signed up.

190
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.296
Well, that's not your fault.

191
00:08:21.298 --> 00:08:24.633
I called the department
secretary to see what happened.

192
00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:28.637
Apparently, I have a reputation
for being obnoxious.

193
00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:32.024
What?

194
00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:35.044
Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

195
00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:37.062
No, it's fine.

196
00:08:37.064 --> 00:08:41.400
Now I can devote all my time
to dark matter.

197
00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:44.403
Aw, you brought cookies
for everyone?

198
00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:45.771
Oh, yes. Fig Newtons.

199
00:08:45.773 --> 00:08:48.524
which scientist both helped

200
00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:51.944
to develop calculus and had
a famous cookie named after him?

201
00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:53.412
And then after
someone said "Newton,"

202
00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:55.781
I was going to tell them
they're wrong.

203
00:08:57.267 --> 00:09:00.452
The cookies are named
after a town in Massachusetts.

204
00:09:00.454 --> 00:09:03.255
And then I'd throw
the cookies away.

205
00:09:04.874 --> 00:09:06.875
Hey, what if I took your class?

206
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:09.795
Why would you do that?

207
00:09:09.797 --> 00:09:11.797
Yeah, why would you do that?
What's wrong with you?

208
00:09:12.348 --> 00:09:14.683
I'm thinking about
getting my doctorate,

209
00:09:14.685 --> 00:09:16.351
and he wants to teach-- why not?

210
00:09:16.353 --> 00:09:18.020
Oh, Howard.

211
00:09:18.022 --> 00:09:20.139
I appreciate
the gesture,

212
00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:22.808
but this is
a graduate-level physics class.

213
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.811
I don't think you'd understand

214
00:09:25.813 --> 00:09:28.864
a single thing
I was talking about.

215
00:09:29.816 --> 00:09:32.701
Ask why not again;
I've got an answer.

216
00:09:32.703 --> 00:09:36.455
Sheldon, I'm more than smart
enough to take your class.

217
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:40.576
No.

218
00:09:42.078 --> 00:09:43.295
Yes.

219
00:09:44.798 --> 00:09:46.882
How would you determine
the ground state

220
00:09:46.884 --> 00:09:50.002
of a quantum system
with no exact solution?

221
00:09:50.004 --> 00:09:52.471
I would guess a wave-function
and then vary its parameters

222
00:09:52.473 --> 00:09:54.306
until I found
the lowest energy solution.

223
00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:56.475
Hmm.

224
00:09:57.477 --> 00:10:00.062
Do you know how to integrate
X squared times E

225
00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:02.264
to the minus X,
without looking it up?

226
00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:04.566
I'd use Feynman's trick--

227
00:10:04.568 --> 00:10:06.001
differentiate
under the integral sign.

228
00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:08.353
Okay.

229
00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:10.689
Um...

230
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:13.075
What is the correct
interpretation

231
00:10:13.077 --> 00:10:14.576
of quantum mechanics?

232
00:10:14.578 --> 00:10:16.578
Since every interpretation gives
exactly the same answer

233
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.530
to every measurement,
they are all equally correct.

234
00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:20.866
However, I know you believe in
the Many Worlds Interpretation,

235
00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:23.502
so I'll say that. Now do you
think I'm smart enough?

236
00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:28.423
No.

237
00:10:29.876 --> 00:10:31.627
Oh, come on.
You might've gone to school

238
00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:33.679
for a couple more years than me,
but guess what--

239
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:35.714
engineers are just
as smart as physicists.

240
00:10:35.716 --> 00:10:38.217
You take that back!

241
00:10:41.137 --> 00:10:43.856
No.

242
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:53.533
So, after drinks
with Bernadette,

243
00:10:53.535 --> 00:10:56.536
I get home, and Penny calls
to complain about her.

244
00:10:56.538 --> 00:10:58.171
And then while
I'm talking to Penny,

245
00:10:58.173 --> 00:10:59.589
I get a text from Bernadette.

246
00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:02.542
Wh... I'm trying to prepare
my lesson plan for Howard.

247
00:11:02.544 --> 00:11:05.595
Why are you
telling me this?

248
00:11:05.597 --> 00:11:09.716
Because it's taken 15 years, but
high school is finally awesome!

249
00:11:11.636 --> 00:11:13.387
I love them both,

250
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:17.274
but I'm in the center now,
and I love that even more.

251
00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.060
Amy, please. I am trying
to figure out a way

252
00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:24.064
to intellectually emasculate
a dear friend of mine.

253
00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:26.366
But I'm just...
Not now.

254
00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:28.034
You better watch
that attitude, buddy.

255
00:11:28.036 --> 00:11:31.204
You're dating the
popular girl now.

256
00:11:34.242 --> 00:11:36.042
Hmm. You're up late.

257
00:11:36.044 --> 00:11:38.745
Oh, I'm working on
my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

258
00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:40.630
He is going to be so lost.

259
00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:43.667
Look at this section over here.

260
00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:47.003
Even I don't really
understand it.

261
00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:49.973
Sheldon, why are you doing this?

262
00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.725
I'm a teacher, Leonard.

263
00:11:51.727 --> 00:11:53.059
It's my job.

264
00:11:53.061 --> 00:11:54.928
No, I-I mean,

265
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.763
why are you going
to so much trouble

266
00:11:56.765 --> 00:11:58.565
to prove that you're smarter
than Wolowitz?

267
00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:01.685
Oh, it's no trouble;
it's actually a pleasure.

268
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.654
You want to know what I think?

269
00:12:04.656 --> 00:12:07.741
I think the idea that someone
could be as smart as you,

270
00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:10.327
or even smarter,
scares the pants off you,

271
00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.995
and you can't deal with it.

272
00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:15.665
Interesting point.

273
00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:17.534
Wh... You're
suggesting

274
00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:20.203
that I have emotional issues
below my consciousness

275
00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:21.855
which drive my behavior,

276
00:12:21.857 --> 00:12:24.841
thus causing me to lash out
at anything or anyone

277
00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:27.410
that threatens
my intellectual superiority.

278
00:12:27.412 --> 00:12:30.046
Might be something
to think about.

279
00:12:30.932 --> 00:12:32.299
Leonard?

280
00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:33.884
Yeah.

281
00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.552
Howard's allergic to peanuts.

282
00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.637
How can I use that against him?

283
00:12:41.609 --> 00:12:42.943
Hey.

284
00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:46.897
Okay, now that everyone's here,
we can begin.

285
00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:51.468
Before we do,
I just talked to Leonard.

286
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.736
And if you're gonna

287
00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:55.322
spend all your time
trying to belittle me

288
00:12:55.324 --> 00:12:58.208
by making this class
unnecessarily hard,

289
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.160
then I'm out.

290
00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:01.578
But if you're interested
in making

291
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.331
a sincere effort
to be a good teacher,

292
00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:07.133
then I'm willing
to give this a shot.

293
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.222
I suppose that's a fair request.

294
00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:15.675
There's no reason we both can't
benefit from this experience.

295
00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:17.244
Okay.

296
00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:19.312
Okay.

297
00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:21.014
Well, then, uh,
first things first.

298
00:13:21.016 --> 00:13:24.768
Um, are you familiar with
the Brachistochrone problem?

299
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.236
I am.
Good.

300
00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:28.822
And how it relates
to the calculus of variations?

301
00:13:28.824 --> 00:13:30.190
It's an inverted cycloid.

302
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:31.358
Wonderful.

303
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.660
Now, what about
Euler-Lagrange theorems?

304
00:13:33.662 --> 00:13:34.995
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

305
00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:37.030
Ha! I knew it! All right.

306
00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:41.535
We have a lot of information
to cover before your first test.

307
00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:44.371
Which, by the way,
is in eight minutes.

308
00:13:44.373 --> 00:13:47.007
The good news is I'm
grading on a curve,

309
00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:49.709
so you're pretty much
guaranteed a C.

310
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:51.511
âª All I do is win, win, win âª

311
00:13:51.513 --> 00:13:53.430
âª No matter what âª
What are you doing?

312
00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:55.799
âª Everybody hands go up, up... âª

313
00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:57.717
âª And they stay there! âª

314
00:13:57.719 --> 00:13:59.352
What are you doing?

315
00:13:59.354 --> 00:14:00.720
If you're gonna be
a crappy teacher,

316
00:14:00.722 --> 00:14:02.472
then I'm gonna be
a crappy student.

317
00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.190
âª Ludacris going in
on the verse âª

318
00:14:04.192 --> 00:14:06.359
âª 'Cause I never been defeated
and I won't stop now... âª

319
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:09.229
Will you stop it!

320
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:10.564
This is a classroom.

321
00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:12.032
This is not<i> American Bandstand.</i>

322
00:14:12.034 --> 00:14:12.983
Okay.

323
00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:14.067
Now, where was I?

324
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:15.018
Let's see.

325
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.036
Oh, yes. Over here.

326
00:14:16.038 --> 00:14:17.237
You...

327
00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:20.156
What are you doing now?

328
00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:21.975
Making a straw.

329
00:14:21.977 --> 00:14:23.026
Why?

330
00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:26.379
So I can shoot you
with a spitball.

331
00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:30.417
You're not going to do that,
and I'll tell you why.

332
00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:32.586
This is an institution
of higher learning,

333
00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:34.254
I am your professor,

334
00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:36.222
and you're going to treat me
with the prop...

335
00:14:41.562 --> 00:14:44.848
You shot your spit in my mouth!

336
00:14:45.683 --> 00:14:47.434
Is that gonna be on the test?

337
00:14:47.436 --> 00:14:49.686
Because I don't think
I can do that again.

338
00:14:52.406 --> 00:14:54.357
Hey, girlfriend.

339
00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:57.611
Can I get a what what?

340
00:14:57.613 --> 00:14:59.579
What?

341
00:15:00.414 --> 00:15:01.748
Close enough.

342
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.417
Um, I was just calling to see
what you were up tonight.

343
00:15:04.419 --> 00:15:06.536
Thought maybe we could hit up
Color Me Mine,

344
00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:09.873
maybe sneak in
some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.

345
00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.791
Uh, thanks, but I think
I'm gonna stay in

346
00:15:11.793 --> 00:15:13.627
and go over the stuff
Bernadette gave me.

347
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:15.578
Oh. Oh, I hear you.

348
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.164
Try and get that nag
off your back, right?

349
00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:20.734
I mean, you're not a bicycle;

350
00:15:20.736 --> 00:15:23.219
why's she riding you like that?

351
00:15:23.221 --> 00:15:25.338
No, I think she was
just trying to help.

352
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.108
Plus, I really want to do well
at this job. So...

353
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.743
Okay, good luck.
And call me later,

354
00:15:29.745 --> 00:15:32.612
you know, if you decide
she's a bitch or something.

355
00:15:37.735 --> 00:15:39.819
Hey, girlfriend.

356
00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:41.271
Hey, Amy.

357
00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:42.656
Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine.

358
00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:46.826
Maybe we sneak in some Pinot--
make it Color Me<i> Wine.</i>

359
00:15:46.828 --> 00:15:49.129
That sounds fun,
but I promised Penny

360
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:50.497
I'd come by and help her study.

361
00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:53.299
Oh. Well, good luck
getting her to do that.

362
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.969
She's probably off
getting another manicure.

363
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:57.637
You remember when she did that?

364
00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:59.956
You remember?

365
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.175
I was probably being
too hard on her.

366
00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:03.476
We talked, we're good.

367
00:16:03.478 --> 00:16:05.095
Oh. Great.

368
00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.613
I'm happy for you guys.

369
00:16:06.615 --> 00:16:08.398
You know, when the two of you
aren't getting along,

370
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.484
it puts me in a really
weird position.

371
00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:13.670
Well, don't worry--
everything's back to normal.

372
00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:16.773
You mean, like, where she's nice
to your face? Okay got it. Bye.

373
00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:22.846
Hey, boyfriend.

374
00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.364
Can't talk. Spitball.

375
00:16:24.366 --> 00:16:26.166
Probably gonna die.

376
00:16:33.007 --> 00:16:34.340
Well?

377
00:16:34.342 --> 00:16:36.209
Sheldon, I-I promise.

378
00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:39.512
Your uvula does not have an STD.

379
00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:43.349
Are you sure?

380
00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:47.387
It just doesn't feel as
innocent as it used to.

381
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.608
You reported me
to human resources?

382
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.562
You violated the sanctity
of my mouth.

383
00:16:55.564 --> 00:16:58.865
Well, I dropped your class,
so I hope you're happy.

384
00:16:58.867 --> 00:17:01.534
I told you you weren't
smart enough to take it.

385
00:17:01.536 --> 00:17:02.485
I'm smart enough, Sheldon.

386
00:17:02.487 --> 00:17:03.570
Asking me a bunch of questions

387
00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:04.788
about a topic
I'm not familiar with

388
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.739
doesn't prove anything.

389
00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:06.906
I could do the same to you.

390
00:17:06.908 --> 00:17:08.374
Yeah... Try me.

391
00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:10.960
Okay.

392
00:17:10.962 --> 00:17:14.581
You enjoy making fun
of engineering so much;

393
00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:17.667
how do you quantify
the strength of materials?

394
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:19.285
Young's modulus.

395
00:17:19.287 --> 00:17:20.854
Is that right?

396
00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:23.123
Yeah.

397
00:17:24.458 --> 00:17:28.061
Okay, how do you prevent
eddy currents in a transformer?

398
00:17:28.063 --> 00:17:30.313
Laminate the core material.

399
00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.397
Come on, give
him a hard one.

400
00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:33.266
That <i>was</i> a hard one.

401
00:17:34.435 --> 00:17:36.102
All right.

402
00:17:36.104 --> 00:17:39.689
How does the flow rate in a pipe
depend on its diameter?

403
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:43.910
You don't know, do you?

404
00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:47.413
What's the matter, smart guy?

405
00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:49.749
Don't know Poiseuille's law?

406
00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:58.792
Thank goodness I got it!

407
00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:03.930
Now I can quit
checking my stool.

408
00:18:07.802 --> 00:18:10.553
Okay, what are the
potential side effects

409
00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:12.655
for our erectile
dysfunction drug?

410
00:18:12.657 --> 00:18:15.141
Headaches, dizziness and nausea.

411
00:18:15.143 --> 00:18:16.276
Yes.

412
00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:17.610
Those are also the side effects

413
00:18:17.612 --> 00:18:19.779
of having a 75-year-old man
with an erection

414
00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:21.481
climb on top of you.

415
00:18:21.483 --> 00:18:23.483
Want to stop here?

416
00:18:23.485 --> 00:18:24.818
Uh, no.
I can keep going.

417
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.019
Nah, you got this.

418
00:18:26.021 --> 00:18:27.487
Let's go for a drink.
I'll call Amy.

419
00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:30.523
Okay, good. She seemed like she
really wanted to go out tonight.

420
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.417
Hey, girl.

421
00:18:49.868 --> 00:18:53.904
Okay, next question,
for the Butterfinger:

422
00:18:53.906 --> 00:18:56.590
how long is a galactic yea

423
00:18:56.592 --> 00:18:57.908
250 million years!

424
00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.492
Yes!

425
00:19:01.414 --> 00:19:05.749
Okay, this one is
for a Cadbury Creme Egg.

426
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:07.585
It's not even Easter time.

427
00:19:07.587 --> 00:19:09.753
This is crazy!

428
00:19:10.922 --> 00:19:15.226
Which Archimedean solid
has 20 regular triangular faces,

429
00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:17.828
30 square faces,
12 pentagonal faces,

430
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.549
60 vertices and 120 edges?

431
00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:23.934
The Rhombicosidodecahedron!

432
00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:24.518
Yes!

433
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.939
We are so smart!

434
00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:30.658
Why didn't girls like us
in high school?

435
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.787
Because we were awkward and
weird and couldn't play sports!

436
00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:33.942
Right again!
